-- With so many places of interest in Quebec, what inspired your group to focus on the canal for its oral history work?

For more than a century, the Lachine Canal has been ground zero for Canadian debates over industrialization, urban poverty, race relations, urban renewal, deindustrialization, and gentrification.

-- How would you describe the current role of the canal in Quebec life?

It is a visible landmark of the economic, social, cultural and political transformation underway not only in Montreal and Quebec but around the world.

-- In the 1980s or 1990s, is there one specific new-construction or conversion project that you think of as a sort of "temporal dividing line" -- before which the area was industrial and after which it started to become much more residential in nature? If so, how did that project change things?

The Stelco and Redpath condo conversions were very important

-- In which parts of the canal does industrial Quebec still exert the most active influence -- in other words, where have the condos not taken over? How much time do you feel those area have left before becoming gentrified? (If that's indeed the right question -- maybe they stay industrial?)

There is very little industry left. We have highlighted Robin Hood Flour. But there is no industrial zone left to speak of (except perhaps in Ville Emard).

-- Do you see signs of residential over-development? Or, alternately, is there still lots of potential for growth?

Not sure what you are asking here.

-- In your experience, do people still view the canal as being a dirty place? Or has it largely become viewed by the public as a cleaned-up waterway?

The 'greening' of brownfield sites is almost always about 'capping' the toxins underneath.

-- If the area is still seen as dirty, how would you say the responsibility breaks down between public and private entities?

The canal is owned by the federal government so it is responsible for it.

-- Is there any big, looming, privately owned site that people point to and say "if only that were fixed, we would have a clean corridor here"? If so, does that attitude show a lack of awareness of the site's history? 

Not really.

-- Alternately, are there any publicly owned sites that are generally seen as eyesores or problems?

One person's eyesoar is another's beautiful object. Silo 5 is a good example of this divergence.

-- Am I getting off in the weeds by focusing on specific contaminated sites? (In other words: I know there have been several sewage dumps impacting the waterway in recent years -- what factors of this type am I ignoring?)

I like the idea of drilling down into these issues at specific sites.

-- Maybe most importantly: Which big question am I forgetting to ask, and how would you answer it?

Of course people's relationship to pollution has changed within our lifetimes. At one, those who were most impacted by the smoke, smell, sound, and wastes of industry were those who had some economic connection to these sites. This connection has long since been broken. This matters in terms of how we relate to all forms of nuissance and pollution. Here I am thinking of debates around 'noise pollution' from train noise in the Point - where older residents feel it is part of the neighbourhood's long association with industry and newer gentrifiers feel that it has no place in a 'residential neighbourhoood.'
